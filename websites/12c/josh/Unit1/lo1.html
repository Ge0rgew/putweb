      <h4 class="title is-4">Processor</h4>
      <p>A processors role is to the functions of a system by processing instructions and data from the system. A well known processor is the CPU of a computer.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Motherboard</h4>
      <p>The Motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer on which components connect. The mother board contains slots for a CPU and ram and additional slots called PCI to slot in graphics cards and expansion cards.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Power Supply Unit</h4>
      <p>The PSU Converts electicity from AC to DC which the computer can then run off.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Memory</h4>
      <h4 class="title is-4">RAM</h4>
      <p>RAM withholds all programs that are currently running. It Stores parts off the OS that the cpu can access. It is also a temporary stoarge device.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">ROM</h4>
      <p>ROM is a memory that can only be readed. This witholds the OS and BIOS fow when the computer boots up.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Cache</h4>
      <p>Cache stores data that is frequently accessed like websites and files.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Storage Devices</h4>
      <h4 class="title is-4">HDD</h4>
      <p>A HDD (Hard Disk Drive) is a type of storag device that uses a needle to read and write on the spinning metal disks. These are slower as they are done by a moving arm and spinning disks.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">SSD</h4>
      <p>A SSD is a type of storage that uses no moving parts making it faster and use less power.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Optical Storage</h4>
      <p>Optical Storage is a storage that uses lasers to project light thorugh a disk. The main types of Opticical Storage is CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray disks. These rely on a disc drive they are also becoming less used due to streaming platorms and games being digitally download.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Cloud Storage</h4>
      <p>Cloud stoage is a type of storage that you pay for monthly or annually which allows you to store files and photos on servers owned by the company. Most well known companys that do cloud storage are Google, Microsoft and Dropbox. Most allow a free amount of storage which can vary from 2-15GB and then you can upgrade and pay to get more storage. This also allows people to edit the same document at the same time simultaniously</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Expansion Cards</h4>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Graphics Card</h4>
      <p>A GPU Proccesses graphical data and then converts into a displayable output that can be displayed on a monitor or a projector.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Network Interface Card</h4>
      <p>A NIC allows a computer to connect the a network and allows them to transfer data to other devices.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Sound Card</h4>
      <p>This converts digital data to analogue sound waves and the other way round.</p>
      <h3 class="title is-3">Ports</h3>
      <h4 class="title is-4">USB Port</h4>
      <p>A USB port is a port that is widely used to connect usb stick and other external storage devices to a computer.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">SD/Micro SD Port</h4>
      <p>This a port that enables you to plug in a SD card to read and write data on to it.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Ethernet Port</h4>
      <p>This allows you to have a wired connection to either a network switch, router, modem to access the internet.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">SATA Port</h4>
      <p>Allows data transfers to external HDD, SSD or Optical drives.</p>

      <h4 class="title is-4">Desktop</h4>
      <p>A Desktop is a computer that is more sutable at a desk. They tend to be Bulky and Heavy making them harder to move. The components in them can be upgraded individually.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Tablet/Laptop</h4>
      <p>A laptop is a computer that is able to be carried due to them being light. They can do the same tasks as a desktop but the main disadvantage is the screen size as that can b more restrictive of what you can do.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Smartphone</h4>
      <p>A Mobile phone can run a range of diffrent tasks. They are not as powerfull as a laptop or desktop as components have to be small to fit into a case but also have to be able to be powered by a battery.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Embedded Systems</h4>
      <p>An Embedded System is smaller computer that is installed within a larger device. For example smart appliances and lights as they run of a small computer that can only do one thing which is controll a light or a plug.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Mainframe</h4>
      <p>Mainframe computers are huge powerfull computers that reliable. These are used to proccess massives amount of data at once. These are mainly used by scientists to run big caculations. They also require a team to maintain the computers. They are only used by organisations like banks.</p>

      <h3 class="title is-3">Wired Connections</h3>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Copper Cables</h4>
      <p>Copper cables are a cheaper type of wired connection. They can be affected to electromagnetic interferance if not properly insulated. They also more susceptible to attenuation (network distortion). They are also malleable making them less likely to break.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Fibre Optic Cables</h4>
      <p>Fibre Optic Cables are a type of cable that are fast but expensive due to them being made out of glass and use lasers to transmit data. Due to them being made out glass they not affected by electromagnetic interferance and suffer less network distortion.</p>
      <h3 class="title is-3">Wireless Connections</h3>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Bluetooth</h4>
      <p>Bluetooth is a temporary short range communication. Bluetooth is used in wireless headphones to transmit audio data to headphones to convert it into sound waves.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Microwave</h4>
      <p>Microwave connections use raido waves to send data over a large area. The downside is that the transmiter and receiver have to be in-line of sight with nothing inbetween. They are also affetced by weather.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">Satellite</h4>
      <p>Satellite networks use satellites in space to receive and re-transmit data back to earth. Due to the distance data has to be transmitted they is a delay in data being transmitted and being recived.</p>
      <h4 class="title is-4">GSM/5G</h4>
      <p>Global System for Mobile Communications is a technology used to connect mobile phones to the internet for calls and messages and social media. Each new advancement in the technology gives it a new generation such as 4G and 5G.</p>

        <h4 class="title is-4">Hub</h4>
        <p>A hub recieves data packtes from a connected computer of device and then send it back out the every device connected to the hub. This is not secure as if it was a public network then people can packet sniff meaning they can steal your data.</p>
        <h4 class="title is-4">Switch</h4>
        <p>A Switch is like a hub it recieves data from a connected device but then only send the data packet to the specific device listed on the destination packet.</p>
        <h4 class="title is-4">Modem</h4>
        <p>A modem is used to send data over the telephone network. A modem converts the the data into analogueso that it can be transmitted over the telephone lines.</p>
        <h4 class="title is-4">Router</h4>
        <p>A Router is used to transfer data between networks. Data is sent from one network to the other by the internet towards the destination address on the data packets. A Router stores the address of each computer on the network and used caculations to find the quickest way to give it the data packet.</p>
        <h4 class="title is-4">Wireless Access Point</h4>
        <p>A wireless Access Point is used to connect wireless devices to a wired network</p>
        <h4 class="title is-4">Combined Device</h4>
        <p>The most common Combined Device is the Wifi Boxs that we have in our houses as the are a Router, Modem, Switch and Wireless Access Point all in one.</p>

        <h4 class="title is-4">Event Viewer</h4>
        <p>Event Viewer is a type of software that is used to list details of the error that occured to help fix the issue.</p>
        <h4 class="title is-4">Power On Self Test</h4>
        <p>On Startup, POST checks memory, power, hardware and cooling systems are working correctly. If not then it usally if there is a error it will beep multiple times and display an error code on the motherboard.</p>
        <h4 class="title is-4">Ping Test</h4>
        <p>This is a connectivity test between to devices. A computer sends out a message and then waits for an echo reply. This can be repeated to find out what device is causing the issue.</p>
